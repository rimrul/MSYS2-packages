name: Sync packages with upstream

# Git for Windows is a slightly modified subset of MSYS2. Some of its
# components are maintained by Git for Windows, others by MSYS2. Since 
# Git for Windows currently needs i686 versions of some packages maintained
# by MSYS2 and they don't build them for that architecture, this workflow
# monitors their git repository and opens new pull requests for updated packages.
